This project focuses on training a QNN for galaxy detection using a telescope image.
The study investigates how the efficiency of the QNN varies with different data encoders and different training dataset sizes, and the model has been tested on test datasets.

The entire content and steps of the project are provided in the Colab file.
The Workspace(2).zip file should be uploaded to Colab and unzipped using the code included in the file.
All necessary data to be used in the code is contained within the file. 
The directories .../Dataset/Original/galaxy and .../Dataset/Original/No-galaxy include the training data to be used for training the model.
The directories .../test/galaxytest and .../test/nogalaxytest consist of the test dataset, which contains data not used during training.
If desired, the data in these folders can also be modified.
